# ondemand(od): Faust's new reactive primitive

### Does FAUST operate in discreet or continuous time?

### What does the new ondemand primitive offer/solve?

### How is ondemand implemented under the hood?

### How does ondemand present us with reactive paradigms that don't already exist (i.e. sliders, buttons, osc, etc...)?

Avoids unecessary computation.

### How do functions with ondemand primitives compose in sequence/parallel/recursion?

### Are there any specific ondemand operators to consider?

ox

### Does the ondemand primitive bring Faust closer to modelling functional reactive paradigms? What about arrow diagrams?
